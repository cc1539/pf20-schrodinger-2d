# Gravity + 2D Schrodinger Equation Simulation

My take on simulating the effect of gravity on wavelets evolving according to the Schrodinger equation on a wrapping 2D surface. There isn't really a rigorous scientific basis behind this, but when I found out there was a way to seemingly arbitrarily accelerate Schrodinger wavelets, I thought it would be interesting to see how it would look if I manifested this in the form of a pseudo-Newtonian gravitational well, which can be introduced and moved around by the user by using the middle mouse button.
